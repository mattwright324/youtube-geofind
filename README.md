What's unique about this tool? How can you use it?

1. Find cool videos where you live or anywhere in the world!
    - What videos were posted by you in the last week? (find me, past 7 days)
    - What livestreams are running now in my state/country? (find me, radius 500 or 1000, live events only)
2. Use it for investigative purposes, OSINT.
    - Channel searching allows you to check all the uploads on a channel for geotags and displays them in a map.
    - Topic searching allows you to check if any uploads found by regular searching or keywords have geotags (though,
      not many do).
    - Location searching allows you to find videos with geotags within your chosen radius and timeframe.
    - Results can be directly opened in my YouTube Metadata tool to give all details about that video and its
      author.
    - Export results in CSV and JSON and import back to view again
3. Query API to share a search or linked custom search from your own site/tool
